<p> About Me</p>
<p> First off, Hello :). Again my name is Janay. I'm an ambitious and adaptable woman who loves to laugh, live, write, and learn. As far as my professional background goes. I'm fairly new to software development. I've been attempting to teach myself HTML and CSS for a year up til today. I've attained a certification called CompTIA A+ from <a href="https://www.npower.org/about/">NPower</a>. After I graduated the non-profit tech program in december 2018. I felt like what I acheived wasn't enough for me. I worked at a technology company in New York City while working at JetBlue Airways and realized that the position I was doing at the technology company wasn't a good fit for me. At this time I've realized that my passion in technology is learning to become a software developer. My long term goal is to have a career in a field of work thats adaptable, fun, flexible and feeds my curiousity. I feel like software (web) development is the perfect fit for me. </p>
